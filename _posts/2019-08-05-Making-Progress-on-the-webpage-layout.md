Well here I am finally editing and learning how to write my website in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I started using fullpage.js and pdf.js to get my CV and the continous scroll. 
I hope by the end of this week I will actually will have time to finish this. With work, travle,and family it cam prove to be a challenge.
